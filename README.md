# noi
My young noise projects - NoiPla & NoiPro (they're canonically siblings)

## NoiPla
The older sister who likes playing with sliders - slightly more helpful, but unfinished. (Sorry, sweetheart.)

Sports a GUI for making images - currently only supports colours.

## NoiPro
The younger brother who likes writing - more verbose, but closer to becoming finished.

Sports a Syntax Highlighter and custom Programming Language formaking images - syntax works, but doesn't compile yet.
