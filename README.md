# noi
My young noise projects - NoiPla & NoiPro (they're canonically siblings)

Mag from the future here, these projects never grew up. ;-;

Although the idea was nice, it wasn't gonna work out.
If you want to make generative art with a language I've made, feel free to use [Gentle](https://github.com/Magnogen/Gentle).

I suppose Gentle could be their cousin? Idk.
Maybe this whole family/living languages thing is a bit weird.

## NoiPla
The older sister who likes playing with sliders - slightly more helpful, but unfinished. (Sorry, sweetheart.)

Sports a GUI for making images - currently only supports colours.

## NoiPro
The younger brother who likes writing - more verbose, but closer to becoming finished.

Sports a Syntax Highlighter and custom Programming Language formaking images - syntax works, but doesn't compile yet.
